This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-False Positive Report: CVE-2024-38819

Vulnerability Description

The CVE-2024-38819 vulnerability involves a Path Traversal issue in WebMvc.fn and WebFlux.fn, caused by improper sanitization of user inputs when handling file paths. This can potentially allow attackers to bypass security restrictions and access unauthorized files on the server.

⸻

Analysis of False Positive
	1.	Request Sanitization:
	•	All file path inputs are sanitized and validated according to strict security guidelines.
	•	Validation is performed against OpenAPI Specification 3 (OAS3) schemas to ensure compliance with accepted formats and rejection of malicious inputs (e.g., ../ or %2e%2e/).
	2.	Restricted File Access:
	•	File operations are limited to whitelisted directories explicitly defined in the configuration.
	•	Attempts to access unauthorized directories or files are blocked using access control logic implemented at the application level.
	3.	Version Compatibility:
	•	The application uses Spring-WebMVC 5.3.39, a version that addresses many prior vulnerabilities.
	•	Custom sanitization logic in the file access module effectively mitigates any residual risks.
	4.	Testing Results:
	•	Penetration tests confirm no exploitable path traversal vulnerabilities.
	•	Static code analysis tools did not identify issues with the current implementation.

⸻

Evidence Supporting Mitigation
	•	Code samples of input validation and file path sanitization logic.
	•	Penetration test report showing no successful exploitation of path traversal vulnerabilities.
	•	Application logs showing no unauthorized file access attempts.

Conclusion

This vulnerability is determined to be a false positive due to the presence of robust mitigations that prevent path traversal exploitation.

False Positive Report: CVE-2024-38816

Vulnerability Description

The CVE-2024-38816 vulnerability involves Path Traversal in spring-webmvc and spring-webflux, caused by inadequate validation of file paths in HTTP requests when using RouterFunction with FileSystemResource.

⸻

Analysis of False Positive
	1.	Input Validation:
	•	File paths are validated using custom logic that prevents directory traversal patterns (../ or %2e%2e/).
	•	Inputs are compared against a predefined whitelist of acceptable paths, ensuring compliance with security requirements.
	2.	Application Design:
	•	FileSystemResource is not used for handling external file requests.
	•	All file system interactions are mediated through a secure, validated abstraction layer.
	3.	Environment Configuration:
	•	Operating system-level permissions restrict access to sensitive directories, preventing any unauthorized file operations.
	4.	Testing Results:
	•	Penetration testing confirms no exploitable vulnerabilities related to file path traversal.
	•	Code review ensures that RouterFunction usage is safe and adheres to best practices.

⸻

Evidence Supporting Mitigation
	•	Code demonstrating the secure handling of RouterFunction and file access logic.
	•	Penetration test reports confirming no exploitable weaknesses.
	•	Configuration details of directory whitelisting and access restrictions.

Conclusion

This vulnerability is determined to be a false positive due to comprehensive input validation and secure application design.

False Positive Report: CVE-2024-38828

Vulnerability Description

The CVE-2024-38828 vulnerability pertains to Denial of Service (DoS) in spring-webmvc, caused by inefficient handling of large request bodies in controller methods that use the @RequestBody byte[] parameter. This could lead to resource exhaustion.

⸻

Analysis of False Positive
	1.	Request Size Restrictions:
	•	The maximum request body size is explicitly limited through server and application-level configurations.
	•	Payload size exceeding the defined limit results in immediate rejection with an appropriate HTTP error response.
	2.	Rate Limiting:
	•	Rate-limiting mechanisms are in place to mitigate excessive requests from a single client, preventing resource exhaustion.
	3.	Secure Controller Design:
	•	No controllers use @RequestBody byte[] for large file uploads or similar operations.
	•	All request payloads are processed in memory-efficient ways to minimize resource usage.
	4.	Testing Results:
	•	Load testing confirms the application can handle large request loads without performance degradation.
	•	Logs show no evidence of resource exhaustion or unusual system activity.

⸻

Evidence Supporting Mitigation
	•	Server and application configuration files showing payload size restrictions.
	•	Controller code demonstrating efficient request handling.
	•	Load testing and monitoring reports confirming system stability under stress.

Conclusion

This vulnerability is determined to be a false positive due to proper configuration and design, preventing DoS attacks through large request payloads.
